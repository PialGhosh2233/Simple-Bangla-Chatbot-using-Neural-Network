We created a chatbot using deep learning methods. The dataset, which includes responses, patterns, and tags (classifications), will be used to train the chatbot. We use a recurrent neural network (bidirectional LSTM) to classify which category the user’s message belongs to, and then the chatbot will respond to the user randomly according to the category.
