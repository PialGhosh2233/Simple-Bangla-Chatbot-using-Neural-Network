This GitHub repository contains code for a Bangla healthcare chatbot. This project utilizes recurrent neural network (bidirectional LSTM) to understand user input in Bangla and provide appropriate responses related to healthcare queries. The dataset, which includes responses, patterns, and tags (classifications), will be used to train the chatbot.Then use bidirectional LSTM  to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to, and then the chatbot will respond to the user randomly according to the category.
