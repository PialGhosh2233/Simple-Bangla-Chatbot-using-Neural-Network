We created a chatbot using deep learning methods. The dataset, which includes responses, patterns, and tags (classifications), will be used to train the chatbot.
 We use a recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to, and then the chatbot will respond to the user randomly according to the category.
